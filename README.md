# 🩺 AI-Enabled Symptom Based Disease Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Enabled Symptom Based Disease Predictor is an end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts possible diseases based on user-selected symptoms.
The project combines:
- Machine Learning (**Naive Bayes**)
- Interactive **Streamlit** UI
- AI-powered health explanations
- Chatbot-style doctor consultation
- PDF report generation
This project demonstrates practical application of ML in healthcare analytics with real-world deployment features.
